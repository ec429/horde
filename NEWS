Release Notes for recent versions

0.0.2	2011-08-28
Several improvements to the API; it's now basically sane and it may be possible to avoid further changes to existing interfaces; no promises though.
Use in production environments is still not recommended.

0.0.1	2011-08-09
Somewhat primitive alpha-quality release.  It works (it serves web pages and detects when to run the 'pico' preprocessor), but several of the interfaces are Wrong and Likely to Change.
Use of this version in production environments is not recommended; moreover, effort expended on writing extension modules is liable to be wasted if/when interfaces change.
