Release Notes for recent versions

0.0.1	2011-08-09
Somewhat primitive alpha-quality release.  It works (it serves web pages and detects when to run the 'pico' preprocessor), but several of the interfaces are Wrong and Likely to Change.
Use of this version in production environments is not recommended; moreover, effort expended on writing extension modules is liable to be wasted if/when interfaces change.
